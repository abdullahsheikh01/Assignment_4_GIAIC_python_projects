# 00_joke_bot
This is a **simple joke bot** that interacts with the user. It asks what the user wants, but it only understands one command: **"JOKE"**. If the user types **"JOKE"**, it tells a funny programming joke. Otherwise, it responds with **"Sorry, I only tell jokes."**.

## Features
- **Takes user input** and processes it.
- **Responds to the word "JOKE" (case-insensitive).**
- **Prints a programming-related joke.**
- **If input is anything else, it apologizes.**
