# 03_leap_year
This Python program checks whether a given year is a leap year or not. The user inputs a year, and the program determines if it follows leap year rules.

## How It Works
- A year is a leap year if:
  - It is divisible by 4.
  - If it is also divisible by 100, it must be divisible by 400.
- The program handles invalid inputs and ensures the year entered is a positive integer.
