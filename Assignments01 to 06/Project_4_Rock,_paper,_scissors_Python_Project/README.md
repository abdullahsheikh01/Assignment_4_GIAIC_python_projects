# **Project_4_Rock,_paper,_scissors_Python_Project**
This is a simple **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where you play against the computer. You select **Rock (R), Paper (P), or Scissors (S)**, and the computer makes a random choice. The winner is determined based on the classic game rules.

## How It Works
1. The user **inputs their choice**:
   - `"R"` → Rock 🪨
   - `"S"` → Scissors ✂️
   - `"P"` → Paper 📄
2. The **computer randomly picks** one of the three options.
3. The choices are compared, and the winner is announced based on the rules:
   - **Rock beats Scissors** → 🪨 > ✂️
   - **Scissors beats Paper** → ✂️ > 📄
   - **Paper beats Rock** → 📄 > 🪨
   - If both choices are the same, it's a **tie**.

## Features
- Simple, **interactive** gameplay.
- **Randomized computer choices** for a fair game.
- **Instant winner determination** based on classic rules.
