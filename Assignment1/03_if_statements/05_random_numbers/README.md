# 05_random_numbers

This Python program generates **10 random numbers** between **1 and 100** and prints them as a comma-separated list.

## How It Works
- The program defines a range **(1 to 100)** for random number generation.
- It generates **10 random integers** using the `random.randint()` function.
- The numbers are stored in a list and then printed in a formatted way.
