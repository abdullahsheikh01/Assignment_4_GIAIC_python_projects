# 04_tall_enough_to_ride
## Description
This Python program checks whether a user is tall enough to ride a roller coaster. The user enters their height in inches, and the program determines if they meet the minimum height requirement.

## How It Works
- The program sets a **minimum height requirement** of **50 inches**.
- If the user's height is **50 inches or more**, they are eligible to ride.
- If their height is **less than 50 inches**, they are not eligible.
- The program handles invalid inputs (e.g., negative numbers or non-numeric values) and ask again and again for input untill user input positive number to get answer.
