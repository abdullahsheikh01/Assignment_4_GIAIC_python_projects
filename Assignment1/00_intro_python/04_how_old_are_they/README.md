# 04_how_old_are_they
This Python script calculates and displays the ages of five friends—Anton, Beth, Chen, Drew, and Ethan—based on a given riddle. It determines each person's age using predefined mathematical relationships and presents the results in a structured format.
## Riddle Logic:
+ Anton is 21 years old.
+ Beth is 6 years older than Anton.
+ Chen is 20 years older than Beth.
+ Drew's age is Chen’s age +  Anton’s age.
+ Ethan is the same age as Chen.
