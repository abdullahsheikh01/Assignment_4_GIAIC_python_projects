# 00_count_nums
## Description
This Python program counts how many times each number appears in a **user-provided list**. It uses a **dictionary** to store the count of each number.

## How It Works
1. The program continuously prompts the user to enter numbers.
2. When the user presses **Enter** without typing anything, input collection stops.
3. A dictionary stores the count of each unique number.
4. The program prints the frequency of each number
